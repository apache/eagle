/**
 * to provide extensibility, we need a clear differentiation between framework job and provider logic
 * policy evaluator framework:
 * - connect to eagle data source
 * - read all policy definitions
 * - compare with cached policy definitions
 * - figure out if policy is created, deleted or updated
 *   - if policy is created, then invoke onPolicyCreated
 *   - if policy is deleted, then invoke onPolicyDeleted
 *   - if policy is updated, then invoke onPolicyUpdated
 * - for policy update, replace old evaluator engine with new evaluator engine which is created by policy evaluator provider
 * - specify # of executors for this alert executor id
 * - dynamically balance # of policies evaluated by each alert executor
 *   - use zookeeper to balance. eaglePolicies/${alertExecutorId}/${alertExecutorInstanceId} => list of policies
 * 
 * policy evaluator business features:
 * - register mapping between policy type and PolicyEvaluator
 * - create evaluator engine runtime when configuration is changed
