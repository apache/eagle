# ---------------------------------------------
# Eagle Authentication Configuration
# ---------------------------------------------
auth:
  # indicating if authentication is enabled, true for enabled, false for disabled
  enabled: false

  # indicating authentication mode, "simple" or "ldap"
  mode: simple

  # indicating whether to use cache: cache is usually used for authentications that may
  # not handle high throughput (an RDBMS or LDAP server, for example)
  caching: false

  # indicating the cache policy, containing maximumSize and expireAfterWrite, e.g. maximumSize=10000, expireAfterWrite=10m
  cachePolicy: maximumSize=10000, expireAfterWrite=1m

  # indicating whether authorization is needed
  authorization: false

  # indicating whether @Auth annotation on parameters is needed
  annotated: true

  # for basic authentication, effective only when auth.mode=simple
  simple:
    # username for basic authentication, effective only when auth.mode=simple
    username: admin
    # password for basic authentication, effective only when auth.mode=simple
    password: secret

  # for ldap authentication, effective only when auth.mode=ldap
  ldap:
    # url providing ldap service. By convention, the port for typical ldap service is 389, and ldap service over ssl
    # uses port 636 with protocol "ldaps", which requires certificates pre-installed.
    providerUrl: ldap://server.address.or.domain:port

    # template string containing ${USERNAME} placeholder. This is designed for some orgs who don't use plain usernames
    # to authenticate, e.g. they may use its members' email address as the username: ${USERNAME}@some.org. When username
    # is supposed to be recognized originally, just configure this parameter as ${USERNAME}
    principalTemplate: ${USERNAME}@maybe.email.suffix

    # string of strategy used by ldap service. "simple" is usually supported in most circumstances, we can use it by
    # default or leave it a blank string.
    strategy: simple

    # the absolute path of ssl certificate file. This attribute is required conditional only when the auth -> mode is set
    # as "ldap" and providerUrl starting with "ldaps://".
    certificateAbsolutePath: /certificate/absolute/path

    # timeout expression for connecting to ldap service endpoint
    connectingTimeout: 500ms

    # timeout expression for reading from ldap service
    readingTimeout: 500ms
