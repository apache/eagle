# HDFS Data Activity Monitoring

## Monitor Requirements

This application aims to monitor user activities on HDFS via the hdfs audit log. Once any abnormal user activity is detected, an alert is sent in several seconds. The whole pipeline of this application is

* Kafka ingest: this application consumes data from Kafka. In other words, users have to stream the log into Kafka first. 

* Data re-procesing, which includes raw log parser, ip zone joiner, sensitivity information joiner. 

* Kafka sink: parsed data will flows into Kafka again, which will be consumed by the alert engine. 

* Policy evaluation: the alert engine (hosted in Alert Engine app) evaluates each data event to check if the data violate the user defined policy. An alert is generated if the data matches the policy.

## Setup & Installation

* Choose a site to install this application. For example 'sandbox'

* Install "Hdfs Audit Log Monitor" app step by step

    ![Install Step 2](include/images/hdfs_install_1.png)

    ![Install Step 3](include/images/hdfs_install_2.png)

    ![Install Step 4](include/images/hdfs_install_3.png)


## How to collect the log

To collect the raw audit log on namenode servers, a log collector is needed. Users can choose any tools they like. There are some common solutions available: [logstash](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/getting-started-with-logstash.html), [filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-getting-started.html), log4j appender, etcs. 

For detailed instruction, refer to: [How to stream audit log into Kafka](using-eagle/#how-to-stream-audit-log-into-kafka)

## Sample policies

### 1. monitor file/folder operations 

Delete a file/folder on HDFS. 

```
from HDFS_AUDIT_LOG_ENRICHED_STREAM_SANDBOX[str:contains(src,'/tmp/test/subtest') and ((cmd=='rename' and str:contains(dst, '.Trash')) or cmd=='delete')] select * group by user insert into hdfs_audit_log_enriched_stream_out
```

HDFS_AUDIT_LOG_ENRICHED_STREAM_SANDBOX is the input stream name, and hdfs_audit_log_enriched_stream_out is the output stream name, the content between [] is the monitoring conditions. `cmd`, `src` and `dst` is the fields of hdfs audit logs.

   ![Policy 1](include/images/hdfs_policy_1.png)

### 2. classify the file/folder on HDFS

Users may want to mark some folders/files on HDFS as sensitive content. For example, by marking '/sys/soj' as "SOJ", users can monitor any operations they care about on 'sys/soj' and its subfolders/files.

```
from HDFS_AUDIT_LOG_ENRICHED_STREAM_SANDBOX[sensitivityType=='SOJ' and cmd=='delete')] select * group by user insert into hdfs_audit_log_enriched_stream_out
```
The example policy monitors the 'delete' operation on files/subfolders under /sys/soj. 

### 3. Classify the IP Zone 

In some cases, the ips are classified into different zones. For some zone, it may have higher secrecy. Eagle providers ways to monitor user activities on IP level. 

```
from HDFS_AUDIT_LOG_ENRICHED_STREAM_SANDBOX[securityZone=='SECURITY' and cmd=='delete')] select * group by user insert into hdfs_audit_log_enriched_stream_out
```

The example policy monitors the 'delete' operation on hosts in 'SECURITY' zone.

```

OOZIE_AUDIT_LOG_STREAM_SANDBOX is the input stream name, and oozie_audit_log_enriched_stream_out is the output stream name, the content between [] is the monitoring conditions. `user`, `ip`, `jobId`, `operation` and `timestamp` is the fields of oozie audit logs.

   ![Policy 1](include/images/oozie_policy_1.png)

### 2. classify the file/folder on OOZIE

Users may want to mark some jobId on OOZIE as sensitive job. For example, by marking '0000101-161115152703493-oozie-oozi-C' as "BASE", users can monitor any operations they care about on these jobId.

```
from OOZIE_AUDIT_LOG_STREAM_SANDBOX[sensitivityType=='BASE' and cmd=='kill')] select * group by user insert into oozie_audit_log_enriched_stream_out
```
The example policy monitors the 'kill' operation on jobId under "BASE".

    ![Install Step 6](include/images/install_jmx_6.png)

## Define JMX Alert Policy

1. Go to "Define Policy".

2. Select HADOOP_JMX_METRIC_MONITOR related streams.

3. Define SQL-Like policy, for example

        from HADOOP_JMX_METRIC_STREAM_SANDBOX[metric=="cpu.usage" and value > 0.9]
        select site,host,component,value
        insert into HADOOP_CPU_USAGE_GT_90_ALERT;

    As seen in below screenshot:

![Define JMX Alert Policy](include/images/define_jmx_alert_policy.png)

## Stream Schema

* Schema

    | Stream Name | Stream Schema | Time Series |
    | :---------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
    | HADOOP_JMX_METRIC_MONITOR | **host**: STRING<br/><br/>**timestamp**: LONG<br/><br/>**metric**: STRING<br/><br/>**component**: STRING<br/><br/>**site**: STRING<br/><br/>**value**: DOUBLE | True |

## Metrics List

* Please refer to the [Hadoop JMX Metrics List](hadoop-jmx-metrics-list.txt) and see which metrics you're interested in.

# Job Performance Monitoring

## Monitor Requirements

* Finished/Running Job Details
* Job Metrics(Job Counter/Statistics) Aggregation
* Alerts(Job failure/Job slow)

## Applications

* Application Table

    | application | responsibility |
    | :---: | :---: |
    | Map Reduce History Job Monitoring | parse mr history job logs from hdfs |
    | Map Reduce Running Job Monitoring | get mr running job details from resource manager |
    | Map Reduce Metrics Aggregation | aggregate metrics generated by applications above |

## Data Ingestion And Process

* We build storm topology to fulfill requirements for each application.

    ![topology figures](include/images/jpm.jpg)

* Map Reduce History Job Monitoring (Figure 1)
    * **Read Spout**
        * read/parse history job logs from HDFS and flush to eagle service(storage is Hbase)
    * **Sink Bolt**
        * convert parsed jobs to streams and write to data sink
* Map Reduce Running Job Monitoring (Figure 2)
    * **Read Spout**
        * fetch running job list from resource manager and emit to Parse Bolt
    * **Parse Bolt**
        * for each running job, fetch job detail/job counter/job configure/tasks from resource manager
* Map Reduce Metrics Aggregation (Figure 3)
    * **Divide Spout**
        * divide time period(need to be aggregated) to small pieces and emit to Aggregate Bolt
    * **Aggregate Bolt**
        * aggregate metrics for given time period received from Divide Spout

## Setup & Installation
* Make sure already setup a site (here use a demo site named "sandbox").

* Install "Map Reduce History Job" app in eagle server(Take this application as an example).

* Configure Application settings

    ![application configures](include/images/jpm_configure.png)

* Ensure a kafka topic named {SITE_ID}_map_reduce_failed_job (In current guide, it should be sandbox_map_reduce_failed_job) will be created.

* Click "Install" button then you will see the MAP_REDUCE_FAILED_JOB_STREAM_{SITE_ID} in Alert->Streams.
    ![application configures](include/images/jpm_streams.png)
  This application will write stream data to kafka topic(created by last step)
  
## Integration With Alert Engine

In order to integrate applications with alert engine and send alerts, follow below steps(Take Map Reduce History Job application as an example):

* **define stream and configure data sink**
    * define stream in resource/META-INF/providers/xxxProviders.xml
    For example, MAP_REDUCE_FAILED_JOB_STREAM_{SITE_ID}
    * configure data sink
    For example, create kafka topic {SITE_ID}_map_reduce_failed_job

* **define policy**

For example, if you want to receive map reduce job failure alerts, you can define policies (SiddhiQL) as the following:
```sql
from map_reduce_failed_job_stream[site=="sandbox" and currentState=="FAILED"]
select site, queue, user, jobType, jobId, submissionTime, trackingUrl, startTime, endTime
group by jobId insert into map_reduce_failed_job_stream_out
```
    
   ![define policy](include/images/jpm_define_policy.png)
   
* **view alerts**

You can view alerts in Alert->alerts page.

## Stream Schema
All columns above are predefined in stream map_reduce_failed_job_stream defined in

    eagle-jpm/eagle-jpm-mr-history/src/main/resources/META-INF/providers/org.apache.eagle.jpm.mr.history.MRHistoryJobApplicationProvider.xml

Then, enable the policy in web ui after it's created. Eagle will schedule it automatically.

# Hadoop Queue Monitoring

* This application collects metrics of Resource Manager in the following aspects:

    * Scheduler Info of the cluster: http://{RM_HTTP_ADDRESS}:{PORT}/ws/v1/cluster/scheduler

    * Applications of the cluster: http://{RM_HTTP_ADDRESS}:{PORT}/ws/v1/cluster/apps

    * Overall metrics of the cluster: http://{RM_HTTP_ADDRESS}:{PORT}/ws/v1/cluster/metrics

            by version 0.5, mainly focusing at metrics
             - `appsPending`
             - `allocatedMB`
             - `totalMB`
             - `availableMB`
             - `reservedMB`
             - `allocatedVirtualCores`.

## Setup & Installation

* Make sure already setup a site (here use a demo site named "sandbox").

* From left-nav list, navigate to application managing page by "**Integration**" > "**Sites**", and hit link "**sandbox**" on right.

    ![Navigate to app mgmt](include/images/hadoop_queue_monitor_1.png)
