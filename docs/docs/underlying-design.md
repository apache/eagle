# Alert Engine


### Distributed Real-time Streaming

Eagle Alert Engine is buit on open source realtime streaming infrastrcuture like [Apache Storm](http://storm.apache.org/) as default execution engine and [Apache  Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) as default messagig Bus.

### Declarative Policy Evaluator
Eagle supports declarative policy with SQL (CEP) on distributed streaming environment.

![Eagle Alert Policy Spec](include/images/alert_engine_policy_spec.png)

Here are some typical examples:

* Example 1: Alert if hadoop namenode capacity usage exceed 90 percentages

		from hadoopJmxMetricEventStream
		[metric == "hadoop.namenode.fsnamesystemstate.capacityused" and value > 0.9] 
		select metric, host, value, timestamp, component, site 
		insert into alertStream;

* Example 2: Alert if hadoop namenode HA switches

	    from every 
		a = hadoopJmxMetricEventStream[metric=="hadoop.namenode.fsnamesystem.hastate"] 
		-> 
		b = hadoopJmxMetricEventStream[metric==a.metric and b.host == a.host and a.value != value)] 
		within 10 min 
		select a.host, a.value as oldHaState, b.value as newHaState, b.timestamp as timestamp, b.metric as metric, b.component as component, b.site as site insert into alertStream;	

### Dynamic Coordinator
![Alert Engine Coordination](include/images/alert_engine_coordination.png)

# Application Framework

Eagle has multiple distributed real-time frameworks for efficiently developing highly scalable monitoring applications.

## Application

An "Application" or "App" is composed of data integration, policies and insights for one data source.

## Application Descriptor

An "Application Descriptor" is a static packaged metadata information consist of

* __Basic__: type, name, version, description.
* __Application__: the application process to run.
* __Configuration Descriptor____:  describe the configurations required by the application when starting like name, displayName, defaultValue Description, required, etc. which will automatically be visualized in configuration editor.
* __Streams__: the streams schema the application will export.
* __Docs__: application specific documentations which will be embedded in necessary area during the whole lifecyle of application management.

Here is a ApplicationDesc example of `JPM_WEB_APP`

        {
            type: "JPM_WEB_APP",
            name: "Job Performance Monitoring Web ",
            version: "0.5.1",
            description: null,
            appClass: "org.apache.eagle.app.StaticApplication",
            jarPath: "/opt/eagle/eagle-0.5.1/lib/eagle-topology-0.5.1-hadoop-2.4.1-11-assembly.jar",
            viewPath: "/apps/jpm",
            providerClass: "org.apache.eagle.app.jpm.JPMWebApplicationProvider",
            configuration: {
                properties: [{
                    name: "service.host",
                    displayName: "Eagle Service Host",
                    value: "localhost",
                    description: "Eagle Service Host, default: localhost",
                    required: false
                }, {
                    name: "service.port",
                    displayName: "Eagle Service Port",
                    value: "8080",
                    description: "Eagle Service Port, default: 8080",
                    required: false
                }]
            },
            streams: null,
            docs: null,
            executable: false,
            dependencies: [{
                type: "MR_RUNNING_JOB_APP",
                version: "0.5.1",
                required: true
            }, {
                type: "MR_HISTORY_JOB_APP",
                version: "0.5.1",
                required: true
            }]
        }

## Application Provider
	
An "application provider" in fact is a package management and loading mechanism leveraging [Java SPI](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/ext/basics/spi.html).

For example, in file 
	
	META-INF/services/org.apache.eagle.app.spi.ApplicationProvider
		
place the full class name of an application provider:

   	org.apache.eagle.app.jpm.JPMWebApplicationProvider

# Metric Storage

## Persistence ORM Framework

Eagle nativelly provides a light-weight ORM Framework for HBase/RDMBS, supporting easily defining persistence data model with java annotation. 

For example as below:

    
    	@Table("HbaseTableName")
		@ColumnFamily("ColumnFamily")
		@Prefix("RowkeyPrefix")
		@Service("UniqueEntitytServiceName")
		@JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)
		@TimeSeries(false)
		@Indexes({
			@Index(name="Index_1_alertExecutorId", columns = { "alertExecutorID" }, unique = true)})
		public class AlertDefinitionAPIEntity extends TaggedLogAPIEntity{
		@Column("a")
		private String desc;

## SQL-Like REST Query Language

Eagle provide SQL-Like REST query language on NoSQL Model. For example like

	/rest/entities?query=UniqueEntitytServiceName[@site="sandbox"]{*}
